An asyncio subprocess wrapper that can watch for its process to exit.

It does so by creating a task on the asyncio loop that blocks until the process exits.

* Usage:

#+BEGIN_SRC python

  try:
      proc: MonitoredSubprocess = MonitoredSubprocess(
          "some_proc_name",
          await asyncio.create_subprocess_exec(
              ...
          )
      )
      await proc.wait()
  except asyncio.CancelledError:
      await proc.stop()

#+END_SRC

Obviously `wait()` also blocks, so you will want it to be part of an
`asyncio.gather()` somewhere.
